# MEMBERSHIP-INFERENCE-ATTACK

Membership inference attacks observe the behavior of a target machine learning model and predict examples that were used to train it. After gathering enough high confidence records, the attacker uses the dataset to train a set of “shadow models” to predict whether a data record was part of the target model’s training data.
